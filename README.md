## 🎉 Intro

**`✅ This is a developer portfolio & blog project made with create-next-app ✅`** 

Hey, there! I'm **`SEUNGMIN LEE`** and I gotta say, I realized i need a new dev portfolio along with a tool to share my knowledge with others.
This project? it’s where my code meets creativity, fueled by dedication 🔥 and late-night munchies 🌃 

Alright, so it didn’t take forever to build, but it’s packed with all the fun, challenges, and aha moments. 
It’s like my digital diary but in code. Every piece of it tells a story of those "Let's just try this" ideas and "Oh cool, that actually worked!" moments 💡

So, kick back, have a look, and enjoy the ride through **`my coding adventure 😎`**
